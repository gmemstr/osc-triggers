	<hr />
	<h3>What is OSC?</h3>
	<p>OSC is a communication protocol primarily intended for sound devices but has been
	  adopted for other things as well, such as VRChat leveraging it to make interactions
	  between the game and other software possible.</p>
	<h3>What is OSC Triggers?</h3>
	<p>OSC Triggers allows us to map "events" to actual keypresses on the host computer,
	  either over the network or from localhost. It's currently developed with a focus
	  on VRChat OSC integration, but is written in a fairly generic way.</p>
	<h3>How do I use it?</h3>
	<p>OSC Triggers doesn't <i>currently</i> have a user interface, but the configuration file is
	  designed to be as straightforward as possible with <a href="https://toml.io/en/">TOML</a>.
	  Here's an example configuration file that will issue a keypress for the F24 key
	  when the user mutes themselves in VRChat:

	  <pre><code>[[mapping]]
event = "/avatar/parameters/MuteSelf"
key = "F24"</code></pre>

	  The event is entirely dependant on the program you're using. You can see an example
	  list of VRChat OSC events <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrchat-community/osc/main/files/avatar-parameters/configs/example-avatar-config.json">here</a>. Custom parameters can be added with some work in Unity.</p>

	<h3>Where can I download it?</h3>
	<p>Downloads are available from <a href="https://github.com/gmemstr/osc-triggers/releases/latest">GitHub</a>. If you know a bit of Rust, you can also build it yourself from
	  the repository <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~gmem/osc-triggers">here</a>.</p>

	<h3>How can I get in touch?</h3>
	<p>You can reach out with Mastodon at <a href="https://floofy.tech/@arch">floofy.tech/@arch</a>, or with Discord: <code>arch#1919</code>. No, there is no Discord server.</p>
